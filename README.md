This repository is the final project for ENM 531 Data-driven Modeling at University of Pennsylvania in Spring 2020. \

FlexTree.py: Main program where the tree structure is defined and the genetic algothrim is run. \
defs.py: Helper functions that must be included in a separate file because of the way multiprocessing.Pool works. \
base_models.ipynb: Baseline models for performance comparison. \
report.pdf: Final report submitted for grading. \
winequality-red.csv: Data retrieved from [UCI wine quality dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality).
